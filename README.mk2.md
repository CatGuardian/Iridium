Iridium is designed to offer a high performance, easy to use and above all, editor friendly ODM for MongoDB on Node.js.
Rather than adopting the "re-implement everything" approach often favoured by ODMs like Mongoose and friends, requiring
you to learn an entirely new API and locking you into a specific coding style, Iridium tries to offer an incredibly
lightweight implementation which makes your life easier where it counts and gets out of your way when you want to do
anything more complex.
