# v4.0.0
 - Removed automatic schema extensions
    This was done for two reasons, firstly it simplifies the process of loading documents from the database a small amount.
    The bigger reason is pure performance. Not only do we cut down on the number of properties which need to be defined
    on new instances (if they aren't in the static schema) but by preventing modifications to the object structure we
    prevent V8 from de-optimizing the code.
 - Instance original object is no longer cloned
    This should result in a small performance boost and shouldn't break any existing code (unless it was doing weird stuff
    with the private API... you haven't been messing with the private API have you?)
 - Removed support for the event emitter implementation
    With the adoption of promises, its use has become less pronounced and its removal will further simplify the codebase
    and help boost performance.
 - All hook signatures have been changed
    The first argument has become the value which was previously `this`. This should enable more explicit code and support
    for TypeScript.
 - Model options `preprocessors` renamed to `transforms`
    Makes it a little bit more clear what these are to be used for
 - Caching infrastructure updated
    We've separated the cache implementations (get/set/clear) from the logic dictating how to cache something (can/key)
    to make implementing the two parts easier. The cache implementation is now set on the core while the model provides
    the cache controller dictating how caching is performed.
